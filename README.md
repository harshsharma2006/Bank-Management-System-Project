# 🏦 Bank Management System (OOP Project)

This project is a **Bank Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python** and a simple **Streamlit web interface**.

The system allows users to create accounts, manage balances, and update information using structured class-based design.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to implement core **OOP concepts** such as:

- Classes and Objects  
- Class Methods  
- Encapsulation  
- Data Abstraction  
- File Handling with JSON  
- Modular Code Structure  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create New Bank Account  
- Deposit Money  
- Withdraw Money  
- View Account Details  
- Update Account Information  
- Delete Account  
- Persistent Data Storage using JSON  

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

### 🔹 1. Class & Object
The `Bank` class manages all banking operations.

### 🔹 2. Encapsulation
All banking logic is wrapped inside class methods.

### 🔹 3. Class Methods
Used to handle shared data operations such as loading and saving data.

### 🔹 4. Data Abstraction
User interacts only with interface (Streamlit UI), not internal logic.

### 🔹 5. File Handling
Data is stored permanently using a JSON file.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- JSON (File-based storage)  
- Git & GitHub
